# CheapTags-electron
I rebuilt [CheapTags](https://github.com/tash-had/cheap-tags) in ElectronJS to learn how to use ElectronJS. 
I did this over a period of 3 days and my JavaScript was rusty so don't mind the code quality. 

This was done for a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FPGFJfrEYUqUKf050drldtntR315jkpN8mtpPB6IlC8/edit?usp=sharing) I did for Dev Days 2018 (an internal conference).
